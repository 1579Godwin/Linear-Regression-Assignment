## 📁 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **simple linear regression** to explore relationships between two numerical variables. The exercise was completed as part of the Data Analytics course at Insight Global Training Academy (IGTA).

The analysis uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to:

- Import and visualize data  
- Fit a linear regression model  
- Interpret coefficients  
- Evaluate model accuracy

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Explore variable correlation visually  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Apply `LinearRegression()` from scikit-learn  
5. Visualize model fit and error metrics
